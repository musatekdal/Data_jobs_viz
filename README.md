Introduction

The data industry is rapidly growing, and the demand for data professionals is higher than ever before. With so much data available, it's important to have tools that can help you analyze and visualize the data to make informed decisions. This Power BI project is designed to do just that. It provides a comprehensive overview of the data-related job market, including salaries, job satisfaction, work/life balance, and more.

Data Sources

The data used in this project was collected through surveys of data professionals from different countries and industries. The data was cleaned and transformed before being visualized using Power BI, a powerful data analytics and visualization tool.

Visualizations

The project includes a range of interactive visualizations that help to identify trends and patterns related to job satisfaction, salaries, and programming languages used in the industry. These visualizations include:

Satisfaction with the job (Salary, work/life balance) graph: This graph shows the level of satisfaction among data professionals in relation to their salaries and work/life balance.
Total amount of survey info: This visualization shows the total number of survey responses received, broken down by country and industry.
Average Age of survey takers info: This visualization shows the average age of survey takers, broken down by country and industry.
Average Salaries by professions graph: This graph shows the average salaries of different data-related professions, broken down by country and gender.
Salary distribution by gender graph: This graph shows the salary distribution of data professionals by gender, broken down by country and profession.
Graph of most used programming languages by voters: This visualization shows the most commonly used programming languages among data professionals, broken down by country and industry.
Country graphs telling where the voters are working: These visualizations show the distribution of data professionals across different countries, broken down by industry and profession.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to download the Power BI file (.pbix) and any associated data files or sources used in the project. The project is interactive and allows you to filter and explore the data by different parameters like countries, gender, programming languages, data-related jobs, workers experiences, workers' age data, salaries, and more.
